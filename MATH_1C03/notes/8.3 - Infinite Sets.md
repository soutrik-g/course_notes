# Infinite Sets
We say $X$ is ***infinite*** *iff* it is not ***finite***

## Theorem
$\mathbb N$ is infinite.

### Proof
Suppose $\mathbb N$ is finite (for a contradiction). Then there is $k \in \mathbb N$ with $\mathbb N \approx \mathbb N_k$. Let $f : \mathbb N \mapsto \mathbb N_k$ be a bijection. Let $m > k$. Observe that $\mathbb N_m \subseteq \mathbb N$, so we can define the restriction:
$$g = f \upharpoonright_{\mathbb N_m} : \mathbb N_m \mapsto \mathbb N_k$$
#### Problem:
$g$ is an injection!
 If $i \ne j, i, j \in \mathbb N_m$, then
 $$g(i) = f \upharpoonright_{\mathbb N_m}(i) = f(i) \ne f(j) = f \upharpoonright_{\mathbb N_m}(j) = g(j)$$
 But then we have an injection from $\mathbb N_m \to \mathbb N_k$, which contradicts pigeonhole!

## Theorem
If $A \subseteq B$ and $A$ is infinite, then $B$ is infinite.

### Proof
Assume $A$ is infinite. Suppose for a  contradiction that $B$ is finite. Then there is some $k$ such that there exists an injection
$$f : B \to \mathbb N_k$$
Then $g = f \upharpoonright_A : A \to \mathbb N_k$ is an injection
But then $A$ must be finite, a contradiction.

## Corollary
$\mathbb Z, \mathbb Q, \mathbb R, \mathbb C, \dots$ are all infinite.

## Definition
Let $X$ be a set. We say 
1. $X$ is ***denumerable/enumerable*** *iff* there exists a bijection $f : \mathbb N \xrightarrow[onto]{1-1} X$ , i.e., $X \approx \mathbb N$ (can index each element of $X$)
2. $X$ is ***countable*** *iff* $X$ is enumerable or finite.
3. $X$ is ***uncountable*** *iff* $X$ is not countable.

## Theorem
Suppose there is a surjection $f : \mathbb N \to A$. Then $A$ is countable.

*Idea*: $f$ may fail to be injective (there could be repeated values) but we may "delete" the repeats and construct a bijection.

## Theorem
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are denumerable. Then $A \cup B$ is denumerable.

### Proof
Suppose $f : \mathbb N \to A$ and $S : \mathbb N \mapsto B$ are bijections.
We want to "weave" or "dovetail". 

$$\begin{gather*}
	1 \mapsto f(1) \\
	2 \mapsto g(1) \\
	3 \mapsto f(2) \\
	4 \mapsto g(2) \\
	5 \mapsto f(3) \\
	6 \mapsto g(3) \\
	\vdots
\end{gather*}$$

Define a function $h : \mathbb N \to A \cup B$ by
$$
	h (n) = \begin{cases}
		f(\tfrac{n+1}{2}) \text{, if $n$ is odd} \\
		g(\tfrac{n}{2}) \text{, if $n$ is even} \\
	\end{cases}
$$
By the last theorem, we only need to check that this is surjective.

Let $y \in A \cup B$.

#### Case $y \in A$
- There is some $k \in \mathbb N$ such that $f(k) = y$.
- Consider $n = 2k - 1$.
- Then $h(n) = h(2k-1) = f(\tfrac{(2k-1)+1}{2}) = f(\tfrac{2k}{2}) = f(k) = y$.

#### Case $y \in B$
- There is some $k \in \mathbb N$ s.t. $g(k) = y$.
- Let $n = 2k$.
- Then $h(n) = h(2k) = g(\tfrac{2k}{2}) = g(k) = y$.

$\therefore$ $h : \mathbb N \to A \cup B$ is onto and so $A \cup B$ is *denumerable*.

## Theorem
$\mathbb Q$ is denumerable.

### Proof
- Want to number all rationals (possibly with repeats).
- Construct a surjection from $\mathbb N \to \mathbb Q$.
- Let enumerate $\mathbb Q^+$ (then use that $\mathbb Q = \mathbb Q^+ \cup Q^- \cup \{ 0 \})$
- Let's arrange $\mathbb Q^+$ in a *grid*.

![[Pasted image 20220405121320.png]]

In this way we enumerate all of $\mathbb Q^+$
- So $\mathbb Q^+$ is enumerable.
- $\mathbb Q^-$ is enumerable because $f(x) = -x$ is a bijection from $\mathbb Q^+ \to \mathbb Q^-$
- So $\mathbb Q^+ \cup \mathbb Q^- \cup \{ 0 \}$ is denumerable also.

### Formal Proof
- Show $\mathbb N \times \mathbb N$ is denumerable
- Show $(n, m) \mapsto (\tfrac n m) \in \mathbb Q^+$ is a surjection.

## Theorem
Let $B \subseteq A$ with $B$ infinite. If $A$ is enumerable then $B$ is enumerable as well. 

### Proof
A technique called recursion.

Assume $B \subseteq A$, $B$ infinite.
- Assume $A$ is enumerable
	- i.e., can find a bijection $f : \mathbb N \mapsto A$. 
- *Goal*: Construct ("recursively") a bijection
  $$g : \mathbb N \mapsto B$$
- *First* want to define $g(1)$.
	- Consider the set
	  $$G_1 = \{ k \in \mathbb N : f(k) \in B \} \subseteq \mathbb Z^+$$
- $G_1 \ne \emptyset$ since $B \subseteq A$ and $f : \mathbb N \mapsto A$ is onto. So, for any $b \in B$, $b \in A$, so $\exists k$ s.t. $f(k) = b$.
- By the well-ordering principle, $G_1$ has a least element.
- Define $g(1) = f(\text{min } G_1)$.

***Recursive Hypothesis***: Assume that $g(1), \dots, g(n)$ have been defined such that $g(1) \ne g(2) \ne g(3) \ne \dots \ne g(n)$. So far, $g$ is injective!
- Assume that for $1 \le i \le n$, if $f(i) \in B$ then $f(i) \in \{ g(1), \dots, g(n) \}$.

***Recursive Step***: We want to define $g(n+1)$.
- Consider the set
	$$G_{n+1} = \{ k \in \mathbb N : f(k) \in B - \{ f(1), \dots, f(n) \} \}$$
- Since $B$ is infinite, $B - \{ f(1), \dots, f(n) \} \ne \emptyset$
- Since $f : \mathbb N \mapsto A \supseteq B - \{ f(1), \dots, f(n) \}$ is onto, there is $k \in \mathbb N$ s.t. $f(k) \in B - \{ f(1), \dots, f(n) \}$.
- i.e., $G_{n+1} \ne \emptyset$.
- By well ordering, $G_{n+1}$ has a least element.
- *Define*: $g(n+1) = f(\text{min } G_{n+1})$.

So, for every $n \in \mathbb N$, we have given a method of defining $g(n)$. Hence we have a function 
$$g : \mathbb N \mapsto B$$

We should convince ourselves that this $g$ is a bijection.

#### 1-1
- At the $n + 1$ step:
	$$G_{n+1} = \{ k : f(k) \in B - \{ f(1), \dots, f(n) \} \}$$
- So for any element $m \in G_{n+1}$,
	$$f(m) \ne f(1), f(2), \dots, f(n)$$
	But the right side contains all of $g(i)$ for $i \le n$.
- In particular,
	$$g(n+1) = f(\text{min } G_{n+1}) \ne f(1), \dots, f(n)$$
	$$\text{so } g(n+1) \ne g(1), g(2), \dots, g(n)$$
	so $g$ must be 1-1.

#### Onto
- Let $b \in B$. 
- since $f : \mathbb N \mapsto A \supseteq B$ is onto, the set $\{ k \in \mathbb N : f(k) = b \} \ne \emptyset$.
- By well-ordering, let $K_1 = min\{ k : f(k) = b \}$. 
- Consider the set
	$$G_{K} = \{ j \in \mathbb N : f(j) \in B - \{ f(1), \dots, f(K - 1) \} \}$$
	*Note*: $K \in G_K$. 
	*Claim*: $K = \text{min } G_K$. 
- By the minimality of $K$, if there is some smaller value $l \in G_K$, then $f(l) \in B$ but $f(l) \in \{ f(1), \dots, f(K-1) \}$. So $f(l) \notin B - \{f(1), \dots, f(K-1)\}$, a contradiction.
- So $K = \text{min } G_K$
- So $g(K) = f(\text{min } G_K) = f(K) = b$.

## Corollary
Suppose $A \supseteq B$. If $A$ is countable, then $B$ is countable. Contrapositive: If $B$ is uncountable, then $A$ is uncountable.

Want to construct a set that is too big to be numbered. So it suffices to find an uncountable subset.

## Theorem
$(0, 1) \subseteq \mathbb R$ is uncountable.

*Slight Blackbox Decimal Expansions*: 
- $r \in \mathbb R$ we can find a decimal expansion of the form
	$$r = n.d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5\dots$$
	where $d_i$ is a digit, $d_i \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, 9 \}$ and $n$ is some integer.

Particular case: $r \in (0, 1)$.
$$r = 0.d_1 d_2 d_3 \dots$$

**Warning** Decimal expansions are almost unique. Some real numbers have multiple decimal expansions (either one or two). Trailing 9s are the only situation where a decimal expansion is not necessarily unique.

### Proof (Diagonalization Argument)
- For a contradiction, assume that $(0, 1)$ is countable.
- Then there's a bijection
	$$f : \mathbb N \mapsto (0, 1)$$
- *Fix some notation*: For each $i \in \mathbb N$, $f(i)$ has a decimal expansion.
	$$f(i) = 0.d_1^i d_2^i \dots$$	
	where $d_j^i \in \{0, 1, \dots, 8, 9 \}$.
- Let's write down a list:
	![[Pasted image 20220408115424.png]]
- By assumption, $f$ is onto, so every element of $(0, 1)$ must appear in this list. So let's produce a real number $r \in (0, 1)$ which is not in the list.
- Consider the real number
	$$0.r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4 r_5 \dots$$
	such that 
	
	$$r_i = \begin{cases}
		7 \text{ if } d^i_i \ne 7 \\
		2 \text{ if } d^i_i = 7
	\end{cases}$$
- We claim $r$ is not in the list.
	![[Pasted image 20220408120655.png]]
- For any $i$, $r_i \ne d_i^i$ so
	$$0.r_1r_2\dots r_i \dots \ne 0.d^i_1 d^i_2 \dots d_i^i \dots$$
	must be different. 
- So $r \ne f(i)$ for any $i$, i.e, $r \notin \text{ran } f$.
- So $f$ is not onto; ***contradiction***.


$\therefore$ $(0, 1)$ is uncountable.

## Theorem
$\mathcal P(\mathbb N)$ is uncountable.

## Theorem
For any $X$, there is no bijection from $X$ to $\mathcal P(X)$.
- There is no "biggest" infinity.
