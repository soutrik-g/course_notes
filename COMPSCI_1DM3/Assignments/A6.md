----------------------------

## Question 1 [24 marks]

View the sets below. For each one, determine whether they are *finite*, *countably infinite*, or *uncountable*. If the are countably infinite, exhibit a one-to-one correspondence between the set of positive integers and that set. Show your work and provide necessary explanations. 

a) the odd negative integers \
b) the integers greater than 10 \
c) the real numbers between 0 and 2 \
d) the integers with absolute value less than 1,000,000 \
e) the integers that are multiples of 10 \
f) the set A × $\mathbb{Z}$+ where A = {2, 3}

*a)*
Let $A$ be the set of odd negative integers. Then, let 
$$f(x) = -(2(x-1)+1)$$

#### Prove $f$ is a surjection onto $A$
$\because x-1 \geq 0$, $2(x-1)+1$ are all the positive odd integers. Consequently, $-(2(x-1)+1)$ gives all the negative odd integers. \

$\therefore$ $f$ is a surjection onto $A$ \

#### Prove $f$ is an injection onto $A$
Suppose that $f$ is not an injection. Then suppose there exists $x, y \in \mathbb Z^+, x \neq y$ such that $f(x) = f(y)$. Thus, \

$$\begin{align*}
	f(x) &= f(y) \\
	-(2(x-1)+1) &= -(2(y-1)+1) \\
	2(x-1) &= 2(y-1) \\
	x-1 &= y-1 \\
	x &= y
\end{align*}$$

But $x \neq y$, so there is a contradiction. onto $A$ \

$\therefore$ $f$ is an injection onto $A$. \

$\therefore$ $f$ is a one-to-one correspondence onto $A$. Thus the set of all negative odd integers is countably infinite. \

*b)* The integers greater than 10 are countably infinite. The function \
$$f(x) = x + 9$$
maps all the positive integers to the integers greater than 10: \
$$f(1) = 10, f(2) = 11, f(3) = 12, \dots$$

*c)* The set is uncountable, because any interval of the real numbers are uncountable. \

*d)* The set is finite, because the set
$$\{ x \in \mathbb Z \mid |x| < 1000000\} \equiv \{ x \in \mathbb Z \mid -1000000 < x < 1000000\}$$
and there are finitely such integers between $-1000000$ and $1000000$ \

*e)* The function \
$$f(x) = \begin{cases*}
	-10 \left( \frac{x+1} 2 \right), \text{ if } x \text{ is odd} \\
	10 \left( \frac{x} 2 \right), \text{ if } x \text{ is even} \\
\end{cases*}$$
maps all the natural numbers to the integers that are multiples of 10 \

### Proof
Let $A$ be the integers that are multiples of 10. Then, we must prove that the set $\mathbb Z^+$ can be a bijection onto $A$. \

Suppose $a$ is an arbitrary integer in $A$. Then by definition of multiplicity, there exists an integer $k$ such that $a = 10k$. \

#### Prove $f$ is a surjection onto $A$

##### Case 1: $a < 0$.
Then, suppose we evaluate $f(-2k-1)$.  \

###### Observe
$\because a < 0$, we have that $k < 0$ as well. Then, \

$$\begin{align*}
	k &< 0 \\
	k &\leq -1 \\
	-k &\geq 1 \\
	-2k &\geq 2 \\
	-2k -1 &\geq 1 > 0 \\
\end{align*}$$

Thus $-2k-1 \in \mathbb N$, hence $f(-2k-1)$ is well defined. Additionally,

$$\begin{align*}
	-2k-1 &= -2k-2+1 \\
	&= 2(-k-1) + 1
\end{align*}$$

$\because -k-1 \in \mathbb Z$, we have that $-2k-1$ is odd. And so, \

$$\begin{align*}
	f(-2k-1)
	&= 
		-10\left( \frac{-2k-1+1} 2 \right)
	\\&=
		-10\left( \frac{-2k}{2} \right)
	\\&=
		10k
	\\&=
		a
\end{align*}$$

$\therefore$ For all values $a<0$, there exists an integer $x$ such that $f(x) = a$

##### Case 2: $a \geq 0$.
Suppose we evaluate $f(2k)$. \

###### Observe
$\because a \geq 0$, we have that $k \geq 0$ as well, so $2k \geq 0$, thus $2k$ is in the domain of $f$. Additionally, by definition, $2k$ is an even integer. And so, \

$$\begin{align*}
	f(2k) &= 10 \left( \frac{2k}{2} \right) \\
	&= 10k \\
	&= a
\end{align*}$$

$\therefore$ For all values $a \geq 0$, there exists an integer $x$ such that $f(x) = a$ \

$\therefore f$ is a surjection onto $A$. \

#### Prove $f$ is an injection onto $A$
Suppose that $f$ is not an injection. Then there exists $x, y \in \mathbb Z^+, x \neq y$ such that $f(x) = f(y)$. \

###### Oberve
Suppose $x$ and $y$ are of opposite paraties. WLOG, assume x is odd and y is even. Then, \

$$\begin{align*}
	f(x) &= f(y) \\
	-10 \left( \frac{x+1}{2} \right) &= 10 \left(\frac x 2 \right) \\
	- \left( x+1 \right) &= \left(x \right) \\
	-1 &= 2x \\
\end{align*}$$

But this is impossible in the integers since it states that $-1$ is even, but -1 is odd since $-1 = 2(-1) + 1$ and since no integer can be both even and odd it's a contradiction. \

Thus, $x$ and $y$ must have the same parity for $f(x) = f(y)$ to be equal. \

##### Case 1: $x$ and $y$ are even.
$$\begin{align*}
	f(x) &= f(y) \\
	-10 \left(\frac x 2 \right)
	&=
		-10 \left(\frac y 2 \right) \\
	\frac x 2 &= \frac y 2 \\
	x &= y
\end{align*}$$

But $x \neq y$, so there is a contradiction. \
$\therefore$ $f$ is injective when $x$ and $y$ are even. \

##### Case 2: $x$ and $y$ are odd.
$$\begin{align*}
	f(x) &= f(y) \\
	-10 \left( \frac{x+1} 2 \right) &= -10 \left( \frac{y+1} 2 \right) \\
	x+1 &= y+1 \\
	x &= y
\end{align*}$$

But $x \neq y$, so there is a contradiction. \
$\therefore$ $f$ is injective when $x$ and $y$ are even. \

$\therefore f$ is an injection onto $A$. \

$\therefore$ $f$ is a bijection onto $A$, thus $A$ is infinitely countable. \

*f)* The set $A \times \mathbb Z^+$ is countably infinite. Let \

$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
	(2, \frac{x+1} 2), \text{ if } x \text{ is odd.} \\
	(3, \frac{x} 2), \text{ if } x \text{ is even.} \\
\end{cases}$$

Where $domain(f) = \mathbb Z^+$

#### Prove $f$ is a surjection onto $A \times \mathbb Z^+$
Let $a$ be an arbitrary element of $A \times \mathbb Z^+$. Then by definition, there exists $i \in A$ and $j \in \mathbb Z^+$ such that $a = (i, j)$. \

##### Case 1: $i = 2$
Suppose we evaluate $f(2j-1)$. \

###### Observe
$$\begin{align*}
	j &> 0 \\
	j &\geq 1 \\
	2j &\geq 2 \\
	2j -1 &\geq 1 > 0 \\
\end{align*}$$

Thus $2j-1$ is in the domain of $f$, so $f(2j-1)$ is defined. Additionally, \

$$\begin{align*}
	2j - 1 &= 2j - 2 + 1 \\
	&= 2(j-1) + 1
\end{align*}$$

Thus $2j-1$ is an odd integer. And so, \

$$\begin{align*}
	f(2j-1)
	&=
		\left( 2, \frac{2j-1 + 1}{2} \right)
	\\&=
		\left( 2, \frac{2j}{2} \right)
	\\&=
		(2, j)
	\\&=
		a
\end{align*}$$

$\therefore$ for all $a \in A \times \mathbb Z^+$ when $i=2$, we have that there exists an $x \in \mathbb Z^+$ such that $f(x) = a$. \

##### Case 2: $i = 3$
Suppose we evaluate $f(2j)$. \

###### Observe
$j \in \mathbb Z^+$, and so $2j \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, and thus $f(2j)$ is well defined. Additionally, by definition, $2j$ is even. Then, \

$$\begin{align*}
	f(2j) &= \left( 3, \frac{2j}{2} \right) \\
	&= (3, j) \\
	&= a
\end{align*}$$

$\therefore$ for all $a \in A \times \mathbb Z^+$ when $i=3$, we have that there exists an $x \in \mathbb Z^+$ such that $f(x) = a$. \

$\therefore$ $f$ is a surjection onto $A \times \mathbb Z^+$. \

#### Prove $f$ is an injection onto $A \times \mathbb Z^+$
Suppose that $f$ is not an injection. Then there exists $x, y \in \mathbb Z^+, x \neq y$  such that $f(x) = f(y)$. \

###### Observe
Suppose $x$ and $y$ are of opposite parities. Then, WLOG, assume that $x$ is odd and $y$ is even. Then, \

$$\begin{align*}
	f(x) &= f(y) \\
	(2, \frac{x+1}{2}) &= (3, \frac y 2) \\
\end{align*}$$

is a contradiction since $2 \neq 3$. Therefore, $x$ and $y$ must have the same parity for $f(x) = f(y)$.

##### Case 1: $x$ and $y$ are even.
$$\begin{align*}
	\left(3, \frac x 2 \right) &= \left(3, \frac y 2\right) \\
	\Rightarrow \frac x 2 &= \frac y 2 \\
	x &= y
\end{align*}$$

But $x \neq y$ by assumption, so there is a contradiction.
$\therefore$ $x = y$.

##### Case 1: $x$ and $y$ are odd.
$$\begin{align*}
	\left(3, \frac{x+1} 2 \right) &= \left(3, \frac{y+1} 2\right) \\
	\Rightarrow \frac{x+1} 2 &= \frac{y+1} 2 \\
	x &= y
\end{align*}$$

But $x \neq y$ by assumption, so there is a contradiction.
$\therefore x = y$.

$\therefore f$ is an injection onto $A \times \mathbb Z^+$. \

$\therefore$ $f$ is a bijection onto $A \times \mathbb Z^+$, thus $A \times \mathbb Z^+$ is infinitely countable. \

## Question 7 [12 marks]
Let P(n) be the statement that $1^3 + 2^3 ... + n^3 = (n(n+1)/2)^2$ for the positive integer n. \
a) What is the statement P(1), and show that P(1) is true. [2 marks] \
b) What is the inductive hypothesis? [2 marks] \
c) What do you need to prove in the inductive step? [3 marks] \
d) Complete the inductive step, identifying where you use the inductive hypothesis [4 marks] \
e) Explain why these steps show that this formula is true whenever n is a positive integer. [1 marks]

*a)* $P(1)$ is equivalent  to 
$$\begin{align*}
	1^3 &= (1(1+1)/2)^2 \\
	1 &= (2/2)^2 \\
	1 &= 1 \\
\end{align*}$$
Thus it is true.

*b)* The induction hypothesis is that $1^3 + 2^3 ... + n^3 = (n(n+1)/2)^2$.

*c)* We must prove that $P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)$, i.e. When 
$$1^3 + 2^3 ... + n^3 = (n(n+1)/2)^2$$
is true, then
$$1^3 + 2^3 ... + n^3 + (n+1)^3 = ((n+1)((n+1)+1)/2)^2$$

*d)* Let $n \in \mathbb Z^+$ and assume that the inductive hypothesis, $P(n)$, is true. Then, prove that $P(n+1)$ is true.

$$\begin{align*}
	&1^3 + 2^3 ... + n^3 + (n+1)^3 \\
	&= (1^3 + 2^3 ... + n^3) + (n+1)^3 \\
	\tag{By the Induction Hypothesis}
	&= (n(n+1)/2)^2 + (n+1)^3 \\
	&= (n+1)^2(n^2 / 4 + n + 1) \\
	&= (n+1)^2((n^2 + 4n + 4) / 4) \\
	&= (n+1)^2((n + 2)^2 / 4) \\
	&= ((n+1)(n + 2) / 2)^2 \\
	&= ((n+1)((n + 1) + 1) / 2)^2 \\
\end{align*}$$

As desired. Hence $P(n+1)$ is true.

*e)* Starting at the base case, since $P(1)$ was proven to be true, then $P(2)$ is true since $P(n) \implies P(n+1)$ was proven to be true in the inductive step. But since $P(2)$ is true, then $P(3)$ must also be true, and it similiarily continues this way for the remaining positive integers. Thus, these steps show that it is true for all the positive integers.

## Question 8 [8 marks]
Prove that 3 divides $n^3 + 2n$ whenever n is a positive
integer using a base case and inductive hypothesis.

## BONUS Question 9 [10 marks] 
Show that $\mathbb{Z}_m$ with addition modulo m, where m ≥ 2 is an integer, satisfies the closure, associative, and commutative properties, 0 is an additive identity, and for every nonzero a ∈ $\mathbb{Z}_m$, m − a is an inverse of a modulo m.

For each proof, let $a, b, c \in \mathbb Z_m$ be arbitrary.

###### Observe
For an arbitrary integer $x \in \mathbb Z_m$, it can be written in the following form:
$$\begin{align*}
	x = m(0) + x
\end{align*}$$

By definition, we have that $0 \leq x < m$. So by the *Division Algorithm*, we have found the unique integers $q, r$ with $0 \leq r < m$ where $q = 0, r= x$ such that $x = mq+r$. In other words, 
$$\forall x \in \mathbb Z_m (x \mod m = x)$$

##### Prove Closure: $a +_m b \in \mathbb Z_m$
$$a +_m b = (a + b) \text{ mod } m$$

###### Observe
By definition, $(a+b) \text{ mod } m$ is the remainder. But by the *Division Algorithm*, we have that the remainder $r$ satisfies $0 \leq r < m$. Thus, $0 \leq (a + b) \text{ mod } m < m$ and so by the definition of the set $\mathbb Z_m$, $(a + b) \text{ mod } m \in \mathbb Z_m$.

$\therefore$ $\mathbb Z_m$ satisfies closure under addition.

##### Prove Associativity: $(a +_m b) +_m c = a +_m (b +_m c)$
$$\begin{align*}
	(a +_m b) +_m c 
	&=
		(a + b) \text{ mod } m +_m c
	\\&=
		((a + b) \text{ mod } m + c) \text { mod } m
	\\&=
		((a + b) \text{ mod } m + 
		c \text { mod } m) \text { mod } m
	\\&=
		((a + b) +  c) \text { mod } m
	\\&=
		(a + (b +  c)) \text { mod } m
	\\&=
		(a \text{ mod } m + (b +  c) 
		\text{ mod } m) \text { mod } m
	\\&=
		(a + (b +  c) 
		\text{ mod } m) \text { mod } m
	\\&=
		a +_m (b +  c)  \text{ mod } m
	\\&=
		a +_m (b +_m  c)
\end{align*}$$

$\therefore$ $\mathbb Z_m$ satisfies associativity over addition.

##### Prove Commutativity: $a +_m b = b +_m a$
$$\begin{align*}
	a +_m b
	&=
		(a + b) \text{ mod } m
	\\&=
		(b + a) \text{ mod } m
	\\&=
		b +_m a
\end{align*}$$

$\therefore \mathbb Z_m$ satisfies commutativity over addition.

##### Prove 0 is an Additive Identity: $a +_m 0 = a$
$$\begin{align*}
	a +_m 0
	&=
		(a + 0) \text{ mod } m
	\\&=
		a \text{ mod } m
	\\&=
		a
\end{align*}$$

$\therefore \mathbb Z_m$ satisfies that 0 is an additivie identity.

##### Prove $m-a$ is the Additive Inverse of $a$ with $a\neq 0$: $a +_m (m - a) = 0$
$$\begin{align*}
	a +_m (m - a)
	&=
		(a + (m-a)) \text{ mod } m
	\\&=
		m \text{ mod } m
	\\&=
		0
\end{align*}$$

$\therefore \mathbb Z_m$ satisfies this property.
