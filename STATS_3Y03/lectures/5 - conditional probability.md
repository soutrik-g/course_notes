> [!EXAMPLE]  Drawing an Ace with Friend
> Probability of drawing an ace from a deck of playing cards -> $\frac{4}{52}$. If your friend draws before you what is the probability of you drawing an ace?

> There are 2 scenarios:

# Conditional Probability
Suppose we have two events $A, B \subseteq S$. We write $P(A | B)$ "probability of $A$ given $B$" to mean the probability of $A$ occurring given that we know $B$ has occurred.

What proportion of the probability in $B$ is coming from $A$?
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

### Question: **What is the probability that the sum of two rolls is greater than 7 given that the first roll is a 3?**

$$\begin{align*}
	A &= \text{"The sum of the two rolls is > 7"} \\
	B &= \text{"The first roll is a 3"}
\end{align*}$$

$$\begin{align*}
	P(B) &= \frac{1 \cdot 6}{6 \cdot 6} = \frac 1 6 \\
	P(A \cap B) &= \ ?
\end{align*}$$

What to know how many rolls satisfy $3 + n > 7$
- 3 - first roll
- $n$ - second roll

The only solution is $n = 5, 6$, so

$$\begin{align*}
	P(A \cap B) &= \frac 2 {36} \\
	P(A|B) &= \frac{\frac 2 {36}}{\frac 1 6} \\
	&= \frac 1 3
\end{align*}$$


> [!NOTE] Product Rules
> 1. $P(A \cap B) = P(B|A)P(A)$
> 2. $P(B \cap A) = P(A|B)P(B)$

### Example: Deck of Cards (Again yyaaayy)
$$\begin{align*}
	A &= \text{"the first card is an ace"} \\
	B &= \text{"the second card is an ace"} \\
	P(A \cap B) &= P(A|B)P(B) = \frac 3 {51} \cdot \frac 4 {52}
\end{align*}$$
