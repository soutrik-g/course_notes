## Theorem
![[Pasted image 20220318162846.png]]

Let $a, b \in \mathbb Z$ arb. at least one non zero.
### Proof ($\Rightarrow$)
If $(a, b) = 1$, then by the (Extended) Euclidean algorithm, we can find $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + by = (a, b) = 1$.

### Proof ($\Leftarrow$)
Assume $x, y \in \mathbb Z$ are such that
$$ax + by = 1$$
*WTS* $(a, b) = 1$.
- Suppose $d \in \mathbb Z^+$ is such that $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$.
- it suffices to show that $d = 1$.
- Since $d \mid a$, there is $n \in \mathbb Z$ such that 
  $$a = dn$$
- Similarly, there is an $m \in \mathbb Z$ such that
  $$b = dm$$
Substituting,
$$\begin{align*}
	ax + by &= 1 \\
	dnx + dmy &= 1 \\
	d(nx + my) &= 1 \\
\end{align*}$$

## Theorem
Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb Z$. If $(a, b) = 1$ and $a \mid bc$, then $a \mid c$.

## Corollaries
Let $a, b \in \mathbb Z$ and $p \in \mathbb Z^+$ be prime. If $p \mid ab$, then $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$.

*Correction:* $p \mid b_{r+1}$ or $p \mid a$.

## Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (Uniqueness)
Every positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes. Furthermore, this product of primes is unique, except for the order in which the factors appear.
