 ## Definition

- The set $X$ is the *domain* of $f$  (denoted **dom $f$**)
- The set $Y$ is the *codomain* of $f$
- If $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$ such that $f(x) = y$, then 
	- $y$ is the *value of $f$ at $x$*
	- $y$ is the *image of $x$ under $f$*
	- $x$ is the *preimage of $y$ under $f$*
	- $f$ maps $x$ to $y$

### Notation
![[Pasted image 20220219234115.png]]

## Definition
Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets, and $f : X \to Y$. The *range of $f$*/*image of $f$*  is  the set
$$\{ y \in Y \mid (\exists x \in X)(y = f(x)) \} = \{f(x) \mid x \in X\}$$
denoted **ran** $f$ or **im** $f$.

### Convention
If we are not explicitly given the domain, we should *assume* the domain is the *largest* set for when the function is defined.

## Definition
Any function of the form
$$\begin{gather*}
	f : X \times X \to X \\
	e.x. \\
	f(a, b) = a + b
\end{gather*}$$
is called a *binary operation*.
