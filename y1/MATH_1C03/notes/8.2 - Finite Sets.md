# Finite Sets
## Pigeonhole Principle
For any $n \in \mathbb N$, and any $X \subsetneq \mathbb N_n$, there is no bijection (no injection) $f : \mathbb N_n \mapsto X$, where $n > |X|$
- *Mathematically*, there is no injection from a finite set into a smaller set.
- *Intuitively*, a bigger set cannot go into a smaller set.

### Proof
By induction on $n$.

#### Base Case $n = 1$
- $\mathbb N_1 = \{ 1\}$
- There is only one proper subset $X = \emptyset$.
- There is no function from $\{1\} \mapsto \emptyset$.
- Nowhere to send "1".

#### Inductive Hypothesis
*IH*: Assume that for any proper subset $X \subsetneq \mathbb N_n$, there is no bijection from $\mathbb N_n$ to $X$.
*WTS*: For any proper subset $X \subsetneq \mathbb N_{n+1}$ there is no bijection from $\mathbb N_{n+1}$ to $X$.
- For a *contradiction*, assume we can find a set $X \subsetneq \mathbb N_{n+1}$ such that there is a bijection $f : \mathbb N_{n+1} \mapsto X$.
- *observe*: $\mathbb N_{n+1} = \mathbb N_n \cup \{ n+1 \}$.
- Consider two cases:

##### Case 1: $n+1 \notin X$
- Then $X \subseteq \mathbb N_n$ (possibly equal!)
- Define a new function
  $$g : f \upharpoonright_{\mathbb N_n} \mapsto X - \{f(n+1) \}$$
- $g$ is injective because $f$ is injective
- $g$ is a bijection because $f$ was onto $X$ so $g$ is onto $X - \{f(n+1) \}$. 
- Then $X - \{f(n+1)\}$ is a proper subset of $\mathbb N_n$
	- $n+1 \notin X$. so certainly $f(n+1) \in X \subseteq \mathbb N_n$. Since $f$ was onto $X$.
	- $X - \{f(n+1)\} \subsetneq \mathbb N_n$.
- $g : \mathbb N_n \xrightarrow[onto]{1-1} X - \{f(n+1) \}$ contradicts the *IH*

##### Case 2: $n+1 \in X$
- Since $f : \mathbb N_{n+1} \mapsto X$ is onto, and $n+1 \in X$, we have that $n+1 \in \text{ran } f$.
- So, we may fix some $m \in \mathbb N_{n+1}$ such that $f(m) = n+1$. 
- *observation*: if $m \ne n+1$, then $f(n+1) \in \mathbb N_n$. why?
	- If $f(n+1) \notin \mathbb N_n$, then $f(n+1) = n+1$. *But* $m \ne n+1$ and $f(m) = n+1$ also, which is impossible since $f$ is injective.
- Define a new function
  $$\begin{align*}
	  g &: \mathbb N_{n+1} \mapsto X - \{n+1\} \\
	  g(k) &= \begin{cases}
		  f(k), k \ne m \\
		  f(n+1), k = m \\
	  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}$$
	- If $m \ne n+1$, we want to replace $f(m) = n+1$ with something in $\mathbb N_n$
	- If $m=n+1$, then we don't really need to do anything ($g = f \upharpoonright_{N_n}$).
- Then $g : \mathbb N_n \mapsto X - \{n+1\} \subsetneq \mathbb N_n$ is a bijection.
	- If $X - \{n+1\} = \mathbb N_n$ then $X = \mathbb N_{n+1}$ which contradicts our assumption that $X \subsetneq \mathbb N_{n+1}$.
- This contradicts the *IH*.

## Theorem
Cardinality is well-defined for finite sets. (i.e., there is a unique $n$ s.t. $|X| = n$ for any finite $X$.).
