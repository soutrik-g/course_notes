# Axiomatic Set Thery
Originally, there were essentialy two axioms.

### Extensionality
Two sets are equal if they have the same elements

### Comprehension
A collection $\{x \mid P(x)\}$ is a set as long as $P(x)$ is well-defined.

These two axioms alone lead to famous contradictions.

Consider the following:
$$A = \{x \mid x \notin x\}$$

*Russel's Paradox*
If $A \in A$, then $A \notin A \Leftarrow$  impossible
If $A \notin A$, then $A \in A \Leftarrow$ impossible.

So Extensionality and Comprehension are not sufficient to define "set."

## Today
- We work with a system of axioms called ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel-Choice)
- Does away with Russel's Paradox by including *restricted* comprehension:
  "If  $Z$ is a set, then $\{x \in Z \mid P(x)\}$ is a set."
