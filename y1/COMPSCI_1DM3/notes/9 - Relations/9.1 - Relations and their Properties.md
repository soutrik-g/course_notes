# Binary Relations
## Binary Relation
A ***binary relation*** $R$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is a subset $R \subseteq A \times B$.
- Relations are more general than functions (An $x$ value can have more than 1 $y$ value)

A ***binary relation*** $R$ ***on a set*** $A$ is a subset of $A \times A$ or a relation from $A$ to $A$.

## Reflexive Relations

- The empty relation on an empty set is reflexive

## Symmetric Relations

## Antisymmetric Relations

- Means whenever $x \ne y$, the corresponding pair will not be in the relation.

## Transitive Relations
