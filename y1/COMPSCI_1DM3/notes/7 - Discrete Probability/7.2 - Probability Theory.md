# Assigning Probabilities
- Laplace's definition assumes all outcomes are equally likely.

Let $S$ be a finite sample space. Let $p$ be the ***probability distribution***. Then,  probabilities $p(s)$ for all outcomes $s \in S$  are not equally likely, and

1. $0 \le p(s) \le 1$ for each $s \in S$
2. $\sum_{s \in S} p(S) = 1$

## Uniform Distribution
Let $S$ be a set with size $n$. For all $s \in S$, the ***uniform distribution*** assigns the $p(s)$ to $1/n$.

## Probability of an Event
Let $E$ be an event. Then $e \in E$ is an outcome in $E$, and
$$p(E) = \sum_{e \in E} p(e)$$

## Combinations of Events
If $E_1, E_2, \dots$ is a sequence of pairwise disjoint events in a sample space $S$, then
$$p\left(\bigcup_i E_i\right) = \sum_i p(E_i)$$

## Conditional Probability
Let $E$ and $F$ be events with $p(F) > 0$. $p(E \mid F)$, read as "$E$ given $F$", is defined as:
$$p(E \mid F) = \frac{p(E \cap F)}{p(F)}$$
## Independence
The events $E$ and $F$ are independent $iff$
$$p(E \cap F) = p(E)p(F)$$

## Pairwise and Mutual Independence
The events $E_1, E_2, \dots, E_n$ are ***pairwise independent*** $iff$ $p(E_i \cap E_j) = p(E_i)p(E_j)$ for all pairs $i, j$ with $i \le j \le n$.

Events are ***mutually independent*** if
$$
	p(E_{i_1} \cap E_{i_2} \cap \dots \cap E_{i_m})
	=
		p(E_{i_1})p(E_{i_2}) \cdots p(E_{i_m})
$$
Whenever $i_j$, $j = 1,2,\cdots, m$ are integers with $i \le i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_m \le n$ and $m \ge 2$.

## Bernoulli Trials
Suppose an experiment has only 2 possible outcomes
- Each experiment is called a ***Bernoulli trial***.
- The outcomes are either *success* or *failure*.
- If $p, q$ are the probabilities of *success* and *failure* respectively, then $p+q = 1$.

### Probability of $k$ Successes in $n$ Independent Bernoulli Trials
The probability of exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials is
$$\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}$$

## Random Variables
The ***distribution*** of a random variable $X$ on sample space $S$ is the set of pairs $(r, p(X=r))$ for all $r \in X(S)$, where $p(X = r)$ is the probability that $X$ takes the value $r$.
