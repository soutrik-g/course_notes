- $u$ is the ***initial vertex*** of the edge and is ***adjacent to $v$***
- $v$ is the ***terminal/end vertex*** of the edge and is ***adjacent from $u$***.
- The initial and terminal vertices of a loop are the same.

## Graph Models: Social Networks
- ***friendship graphs*** - undirect graphs where two people are connected if they are friends (in the real world, on Facebook, or in a particular virtual world, so on)
- ***collaboration graphs*** - undirected graphs where two people are connected if they collaborate in a specific way
- ***influence graphs*** - directed graphs where there is an edge from one person to another if the first person can influence the second person

## Software Design Applications
- ***module dependency graph*** represents the dependency between these modules. The dependences need to be understood before coding can be done.
- ***precedence graph*** - represents which statements must have already been executed before executing each statement
