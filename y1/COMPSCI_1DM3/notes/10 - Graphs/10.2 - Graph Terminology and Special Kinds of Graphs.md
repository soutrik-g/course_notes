# Graph Terminology and Special Kinds of Graphs
- ***adjacent/neighbours*** - two vertices $u$, $v$ are adjacent in an undirected graph if an edge is between $u$ and $v$. The edge is called ***incident*** with $u$ and $v$.
- ***neighbourhood*** - set of all neighbours in a vertex $v$ of $G = (V, E)$ (denoted $N(v)$). If $A$ is a subset of $V$, $N(A)$ is the set of all vertices in $G$ adjacent to at least one vertex in $A$. Thus
  $$N(A) = \bigcup_{v \in A} N(v)$$
- ***degree of a vertex*** - in an undirected graph, it is the number of edges incident with the vertex, with a loop contributing 2 times. Denoted $\text{deg}(v)$.

- Right explanation is bad. 
- Given that the resulting sum is even, and all the numbers being added are odd, the only way for the sum to be even is if there is an even amount of odd numbers.

## Bipartite Graphs
- A set of graph vertices decomposed into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.

## Complete Bipartite Graphs
- A special case of bipartite graph where every vertex of the first set is connected to every vertex of the second set.

- ***Star Topology*** - a complete bipartite graph $K_{1, n}$ in which each network component is physically connected to a central node.

- ***Ring topology*** - Each device is connected to exactly two others in a cycle.
