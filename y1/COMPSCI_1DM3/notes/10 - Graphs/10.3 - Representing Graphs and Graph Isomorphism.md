# Representing Graphs and Graph Isomorphism
## Adjacency List
represents a graph with no multiple edges by specifying vertices that are adjacent to each vertex of the graph

## Adjacency Matrix

- *Note*: The adjacency matrix of a simple graph is symmetric, and the diagonal entries are all zero since loops are not allowed.
- When multiple edges connect the same pair of vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$, the $(i, j)$th entry equals the number of edges connecting the pair of vertices.

## Incidence Matrices

- Rows are the *vertices*
- Columns are the *edges*

## Isomorphism of Graphs

- Difficult to determine isomorphism of two graphs. Worse case is $n!$ complexity, checking every possible vertex pair.
- Less difficult to determine that two graphs are *not isomorphic*. Find a property that only one of the graphs has, the *graph invariant* (# of vertices, # of edges, degree sequence (list of degrees in nonincreasing order)).
