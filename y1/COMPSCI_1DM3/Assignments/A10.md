# 2022 WINTER 1DM3: Assignment 10
## This assignment cover sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3. 

* Instructor: Bin Guo
* Marking: Adam Mak, Hamrish Saravanakumar, Simone Ocvirk (maka9, saravah, ocvirks)

* You will be working on this assignment within your assigned group. Ensure that all students work on the assignment questions together. __ONLY ONE STUDENT WILL BE SUBMITTING YOUR ASSIGNMENT ON BEHALF OF THE GROUP__. All students will recieve the same mark on the group, unless you feel as though a student/students have not contributed to the assignment. If this is the case please reach out to one of the marking TAs so we can work out a solution. __You must write the names of which students contributed to each question at the top of each answer cell__.

* The assignment is __due on Sunday March 13th at 11:59pm__. 

* __Your answer should give full detailed explainations__.

* The practice questions are explained in tutorials and not counted as marks. The full marks is __90__.

* The total marks up to the maximum 100 marks.

* NOTE: Many of these questions deal with proofs. You will __NOT__ achieve full marks on a question if you simply provide an example.

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS!


- __ONLY THE GROUP LEADER WILL BE SUBMIT ON BEHALF OF THE GROUP__


- __YOU MUST WRITE THE NAMES OF WHICH STUDENTS CONTRIBUTED TO EACH QUESTION, THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL__


- __ALL ANSWERS MUST GIVE DETAILED EXPLANATIONS, IN THIS ASSIGNMENT MORE THAN 50% OF EACH QUESTION'S MARKS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE EXPLANATIONS, SO JUST GIVING THE ANSWERS WILL NOT LET YOU ACHIEVE 50%__

## Practice Question 1 (Section 10.1, Exercise 3,5,7,9), Not marked

For Exercises 3–9, determine whether the graph shown has directed or undirected edges, whether it has multiple edges, and whether it has one or more loops. Use your answers to determine the type of graph in Table 1 this graph is.

## Practice Question 2 (Section 10.1, 13), Not Marked

The intersection graph of a collection of sets $A_1, A_2, …,A_n$ is the graph that has a vertex for each of these sets and has an edge connecting the vertices representing two sets if these sets have a nonempty intersection. Construct the intersection graph of these collections of sets.

## Practice Question 3 (Section 10.1, 31), Not Marked


For each course at a university, there may be one or more other courses that are its prerequisites. How can a graph be used to model these courses and which courses are prerequisites for which courses? Should edges be directed or undirected? Looking at the graph model, how can we find courses that do not have any prerequisites and how can we find courses that are not the prerequisite for any other courses?\

## Practice Question 4 (Section 10.2, 3), Not Marked

In Exercises 1–3 find the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the degree of each vertex in the given undirected graph. Identify all isolated and pendant vertices.

## Practice Question 6 (Section 10.2, 27), Not Marked

Suppose that there are four employees in the computer support group of the School of Engineering of a large university. Each employee will be assigned to support one of four different areas: hardware, software, networking, and wireless. Suppose that Ping is qualified to support hardware, networking, and wireless; Quiggley is qualified to support software and networking; Ruiz is qualified to support networking and wireless, and Sitea is qualified to support hardware and software.\\

a)Use a bipartite graph to model the four employees and their qualifications.\
b)Use Hall’s theorem to determine whether there is an assignment of employees to support areas so that each employee is assigned one area to support.\
c)If an assignment of employees to support areas so that each employee is assigned to one support area exists, find one.

## Question 7 [16 marks]

Suppose that your TAs: 
- Adam
- Fatemeh
- Hamrish
- N.
- Simone. 

Each TA will assume one of six responsiblities: 
- teaching
- writting assignments
- grading
- holding office hour
- preparing tutorial material
- writing practice questions 

Each TA is capable of doing one or more of these jobs: 
- Adam could do:
    - teaching
    - grading
    - holding office hour
    - writing practice questions
- Fatemeh could do:
    - teaching
    - preparing tutorial material
- Hamrish could do:
    - writing assignments
    - grading
    - writing practice questions
- N. could do:
    - teaching
    - writing assignments
    - writing practice questions
- Simone could do:
    - teaching
    - writing assignments
    - grading
    - writing practice questions

a) Model the capabilities of these TAs using a bipartite graph.

b) Find an assignment of responsibilites such that each TA is assigned one responsibility.

c) Is the matching of responsibilities you found in part (b) a complete matching? Is it a maximum matching?
