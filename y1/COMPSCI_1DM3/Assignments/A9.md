## Question 1 [6 marks]
A unique coin has a probability of 0.75 of landing on heads. What is the expected number of tails that comes up when it is flipped 8 times?

Since there are only 2 outcomes, it is a Bernoulli trial. The events are also mutually independent, thus the expected number of tails that comes up when it is flipped 8 times is
$$(1 - 0.75) \times 8 = 2$$
$\therefore$ the expected number of tails that comes up is 2.

## Question 2 [10 marks]
What is the expected sum of numbers that appear when 5 fair dice are rolled?

YOUR ANSWER HERE

## Question 3 [12 marks]
Suppose that we flip a fair coin until either it comes up tails twice or we have flipped it six times. What is the expected number of times we flip the coin?

**Soutrik, Felix, Arian**
Let $H$ be heads and $T$ be tails. Then,
$$p(H) = 0.5, p(T) = 0.5$$
since it is a fair coin that will be flipped.

Let the random variable $X$ be the number of times the coin is flipped.

### Case 1: $X = 2$
When $X = 2$, then 2 tails have been flipped in a row. Thus, Theorem 2 of section t.2, we have that
$$\begin{align*}
	p(X = 2) &= \binom{2}{2} p(T)^2 p(H)^0
	\\&= (0.5)^2
	\\&= 0.25
\end{align*}$$

### Case 2: $X = 3$
When $X = 3$, a heads could be flipped in either the first or second flip, with the other flips being tails. Thus,

$$\begin{align*}
	p(X = 3)
	&=
		\binom{2}{1} p(T)^2 p(H)
	\\&=
		2 (0.5)^2 (0.5)
	\\&=
		0.25
\end{align*}$$

### Case 3: $X = 4$
When $X = 4$, 2 heads could be flipped on any flip excluding the last. Thus,
$$\begin{align*}
	p(X = 4)
	&=
		\binom{3}{2} p(T)^2 p(H)^2
	\\&=
		3 \cdot 0.5^2 \cdot 0.5^2
	\\&=
		\frac 3 {16}
\end{align*}$$

### Case 4: $X = 5$
When $X = 5$, 3 heads could be flipped on any flip excluding the last. Thus,
$$\begin{align*}
	p(X = 5)
	&=
		\binom{4}{3} p(T)^2 p(H)^3
	\\&=
		\frac 1 {8}
\end{align*}$$

### Case 5: $X = 6$
When $X = 6$, the first 5 flips must contain 4 heads, 1 of them being tails. The last flip could be either tails or heads, since it ends on the sixth flip regardless of heads or tails. Thus,

$$\begin{align*}
	p(X = 6)
	&=
		\binom{5}{4} p(T) p(H)^4 + \binom{5}{5} p(H)^5
	\\&=
		\frac 5 {32} + \frac 1 {32}
	\\&=
		\frac 3 {16}
\end{align*}$$

Thus the expected value is, by Theorem 1 of Section 7.4

$$\begin{align*}
	E(X) &=
		2p(X = 2) + 3p(X = 3) + 4p(X = 4) + 5p(X = 5) + 6p(X = 6)
	\\&=
		2(0.25) + 3(0.25) + 4(\tfrac 3 {16}) + 5(\tfrac 1 8) + 6(\tfrac 3 {16})
	\\&=
		\frac{15}{4}
\end{align*}$$

$\therefore$ the expected number of times we flip the coin is $\frac{15}{4}$

## Question 4 [8 marks]

Use Chebyshevâ€™s inequality to find an upper bound on the probability that the number of tails that come up when a biased coin with probability of heads equal to 0.3 is tossed n times deviates from the mean by more than $\sqrt n$

![[Pasted image 20220327225936.png]]

Let $X=$ the number of tails that come up in $n$ flips.
$$\begin{align*}
	E[X] &= \sum_{k=0}^n k \binom n k (0.7)^k (0.3)^{n-k} \\
	&= 
		0.7 n \\
	\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k}(0.7)^k (0.3)^{n - 1 - k}
	&=
		0.7 n \\
\end{align*}$$

Also, we have that 

$$\begin{align*}
	
\end{align*}$$

Let $X$ be the number of tails that come up in $n$ flips. $E[X] = \sum_{k=0}^n k \binom{n}{k} (0.7)^k(0.3)^{n-k} = (0.7) n$. $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} (0.7)^k (0.3)^{(n-1)-k} = (0.7)n$. Similiarily, $E[X^2] - E[X] = \sum_{k=0}^n (k^2 - k) \binom n k (0.7)^k (0.3)^{n-k} = (0.49)n(n-1)$, and $\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \binom{n-2}{k} (0.7)^k (0.3)^{(n-2)-k} = (0.4)n$ and thus $V(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 = (0.49)n(n-1) + (0.7) n - (0.49) n^2 = (0.21) n$. Hence $$P(|X - E[X]| \ge \sqrt n|) \le \frac{0.21 n}{(\sqrt n)^2} = 0.21$$

## Question 6 [20 marks]
Determine whether the relation $R$ on the set of all real numbers is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, and/or transitive, where $(a, b) âˆˆ R$ if and only if    

a) $a - b$ is a rational number     
b) $ab \geq 0$    
c) $a = 1$ or $b = 1$  
d) $a + b = 0$  

For all questions, let $a, b, c$ be arbitrary real numbers.

*a)*
### Reflexivity
$(a, a) \in R$ since $a - a = 0$ where 0 is a rational number. Therefore, $R$ is reflexive.

### Symmetric
Suppose that $(a, b) \in R$. Then by the definition of the equivalence relation, $a-b$ is a rational number. Let this rational number be $r$. Then, $a-b = r \Rightarrow b - a = -r$. Since the rationals are closed under multiplication, we have that $-r$ is rational, and thus $(b, a) \in R$. Therefore, $R$ is symmetric.

### Antisymmetric
Let $a = 0$ and $b = 1$. Then $a - b \in \mathbb Q$ and $b - a \in \mathbb Q$ but $a \ne b$. Thus it's antisymmetric.

### Transitive
Suppose that $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, c) \in R$. Then, there exist $r_1, r_2 \in \mathbb Q$ such that $a - b = r_1$ and $b - c = r_2$. Then, $a = r_1 + b$ and $c = b - r_2$. Thus, $a - c = (r_1 + b) - (b - r_2) = r_1 + b - b + r_2 = r_1 + r_2$. Since $r_1 + r_2 \in \mathbb Q$, we have that $(a, c) \in R$. Therefore, $R$ is Transitive.

*b)*
*$R$ is reflexive* because $a \cdot a = a^2 \ge 0$, thus $(a, a) \in R$.
*$R$ is symmetric* because $ab \ge 0 \equiv ba \ge 0$ by the commutative property of multiplication. Thus $(b, a) \in R$.
*$R$ is not antisymmetric* because when $a = 1, b = 2$, $1 \cdot 2 \ge 0$ and $2, 1 \ge 0$ so $(1, 2) \in R$ and $(2, 1) \in R$ but $a \ne b$.
*$R$ is not transitive* because for $a = 1, b = 0, c = -1$, $ab \ge 0$ and $bc ge 0$, but $ac \le 0$ thus $(a, c) \notin R$.

*c)*
*$R$ is not reflexive* because $(2, 2) \notin R$ since $2 \ne 1$.
*$R$ is symmetric* because either $a = 1$ or $b = 1$ such that $(1, c) \in R$ and $(c, 1) \in R$. So $(a, c) \in R$ and $(c, b) \in R$.
*$R$ is not antisymmetric* because supposing $a = 1, b = 0$, $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, a) \in R$ while $a \ne b$.
*$R$ is not transitive* because, supposing $a = -1, b = 0, c = 1$, we have $(a, c) \in R$ and $(c, b) \in R$, but $(a, b) \notin R$ since neither $a$ or $b$ are 1.

*d)*
*$R$ is not reflexive* since $(1, 1) \notin R$ since $1 + 1 \ne 0$.
*$R$ is symmetric* since $(a, b) \in R$ by the commutative property of addition.
*$R$ is not antisymmetric* since when $a = 1, b = -1$, $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, a) \in R$ but $a \ne b$.
*$R$ is not transitive* because, supposing $a = 1, b = -1, c = 1$, we have that $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, c) \in R$, but $a + c = 2$ so $(a, c) \notin R$.

## Question 7 [10 marks]
Let $A$ be the relation {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1)}, and let $B$ be the relation {(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2)}. Find $B \circ A$.

$$B \circ A = \{ (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2) \}$$

## Question 8 [9 marks]
Suppose that $A$ is a nonempty set and $R$ is an equivalence
relation on $A$. Show that there is a function $f$ with $A$ as its
domain such that $(x, y) \in R$ if and only if $f (x) = f (y)$.

a) {(a, b) | a and b have the same parents}
