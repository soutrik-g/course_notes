# General Differential Equations
## Differential Equation
- An equation with an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. 
- Its **order** is the order of the highest derivative inside it.
- To *solve* is finding all formulas for the unknown function.
- $f$ is a *solution* if it satisfies the equation when $f(x)$ is subbed for the unknown function.

# Models for Population Growth
Assume that the rate at which population grows is prportional to the population itself. Then,
$$\frac{dP}{dt} = kP$$
- $P$ = population
- $k$ = proportionality constant

###### Observe
If we let $P(t) = Ce^{kt}$,
$$P'(t) = C(ke^{kt}) = k(Ce^{kt}) = kP(t)$$
Thus any exponential function in the form $P(t) = Ce^{kt}$ is a solution.

Under ideal conditions, the above model is true. But populations level off once the environment approaches its **carrying capacity $M$**. For model to consider both accounts, it must satisfy the following:

So must assume that the rate of population growth is **proportional to $P$ and $P-M$**

### Logistic Differential Equation
$$\begin{align*}
	\frac{dP}{dt} &= cP(M-P) \\
	&= kP\left(1-\frac P M\right) \tag{$k = cM$}
\end{align*}$$

###### Observe
- If $P$ is small compared to $M$, then $\frac P M \approx 0$ so $dP/dt \approx kP$. 
- If $P>M$, then $1-P/M < 0$, thus $dP/dt<0$ so it decreases.
- If $0 < P < M$, then $dP/dt > 0$ so it increases.
- $P(t) = 0$ or $P(t) = M$ are solutions since at least one factor would be 0, thus the population will never change. Generally, constant solutions to are named **equilibrium solutions**.

# Model for the Motion of a Spring
## Hooke's Law
$$\text{restoring force} = -kx$$
- $k>0$ is the **spring constant**.
- $x$ units stretched/compressed away from its natural length

By **Newton's Second Law** ($F=ma$), we have the following **second order differential equation**

$$\begin{align*}
	m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} &= -kx \\
	\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} &= -\frac{k}{m} x
\end{align*}$$

Thus the second derivative of $x$ is proportional to $x$ but with the opposite sign.
