# Separable Equations
- First-order differential equation where the expression for $dy/dx$ can be factored as a function of $x$ times a function of $y$:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)f(y)$$
- If $f(y) \neq 0$, let $h(y) = 1/f(y)$ such that
$$\begin{align*}
	\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{g(x)}{h(y)} \\
	h(y)\ dy &= g(x)\ dx \\
	\int h(y)\ dy &= \int g(x)\ dx \\
	\frac d {dx} \int h(y)\ dy &= \frac d {dx} \int g(x)\ dx \\
	\frac d {dy} \left(
		\int h(y)\ dy 
	\right) \frac{dy}{dx}
		&= 
			g(x) \\
	h(y) \frac{dy}{dx}
		&= 
			g(x) \\
\end{align*}$$
# Orthogonal Trajectories
- An **orthogonal trajectory** of a family of curves is a curve that intersects each curve of the family at right angles.
- Thus its derivative must be the *negative reciprocal* of the og derivative.
