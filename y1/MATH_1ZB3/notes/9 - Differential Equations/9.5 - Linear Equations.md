# Linear Equations
## First Order **Linear** Differential Equation
$$\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)$$
## Integration Factor
We try to find $I$ so that the left side of the **linear differential equation**, when multiplied by $I(x)$, becomes $(I(x)y)'$:

#### Note
To solve $y' + P(x)y = Q(x)$, multiply both sides by the **integrating factor** $I(x) = e^{\int P(x) \ dx}$ and then integrate both sides.

# Application to Electric Circuits
$$L I'(t) + RI(t) = E(t)$$
Where
- $E(t)$ - voltage of an electromotive force
- $I(t)$ - current of the electromotive force
- $R$ - ohms on a resistor
- $L$ - henries of an inductor
- $RI(t)$ - drop of voltage due to the resistor
