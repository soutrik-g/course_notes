# Polar Coordinates

## The Polar Coordinate System
- ***Pole*** - a point in a plane labeled $O$.
- ***Polar Axis*** - a ray starting at $O$. Drawn to the right and corresponds to the positive $x$-axis in Cartesian coordinates.
- Let $P$ be a point in the plane. $r$ the distance from $O$ to $P$. $\theta$ the angle betweeen the polar axis and the line $OP$.
- $P$ is the ordered pair $(r, \theta)$ called the ***polar coordinates*** of $P$.
- If $P = O$, then $r = 0$ and $(0, \theta)$ is the pole for all $\theta$.
- $(r, \theta)$ and $(-r, \theta)$ lie on the same line through $O$ and at the same distance $|r|$ from $O$ on opposite sides of $O$.
- If $r > 0$, $(r, \theta)$ lies in the same quadrant of $\theta$.
- If $r < 0$, $(r, \theta)$ lies in the opposite quadrant of $\theta$.
- $(-r, \theta) = (r, \theta + \pi)$

## Relationship Between Polar And Cartesian Coordinates
![[Pasted image 20220319131111.png]]

- to find ***Cartesian Coordinates*** when ***Polar Coordinates*** are known,
  $$x = r \cos \theta, y = r \sin \theta$$
- to find ***Polar Coordinates*** when ***Cartesian Coordinates*** are known,
  $$r^2 = x^2 + y^2, \tan \theta = \frac y x$$
##### Note
$\tan \theta = \frac y x$ does not give a unique value for $\theta$. Choose $\theta$ such that $(r, \theta)$ lies in the same quadrant as $(x, y)$

## Polar Curves
- ***Graph of a polar equation*** - $r = f(\theta)$, or more generally $F(r, \theta) = 0$ consists of all points $P$ that have at least one polar representation $(r, \theta)$ whose coordinates satisfy the equation.

## Symmetry
1. If a polar equation is unchanged when $\theta$ is replaced by $-\theta$, the curve is symmetric about the polar axis.
2. If the equation is unchanged when $r$ is replaced by $-r$, or when $\theta$ is replaced by $\theta + \pi$, the curve is symmetric about the pole. (The curve remains unchanged if we rotate it through $180 \degree$ about the origin.)
3. If the equation is unchanged when $\theta$ is replaced by $\pi - \theta$, the curve is symmetric about the vertical line $\theta = \frac \pi 2$.
