# Hydrostatic Pressue and Force
![[Pasted image 20220302010313.png]]
- $A =$ area in square meters.
- $p$ kilograms per cubic meter
- depth of $d$ meters below surface of fluid
- Volume $V$ above the plate is $dA$
- mass $m = pV = pAd$
- Force is $F = mg = pVg = pgAd$
- Pressure is $P = \frac F A = pgd = \delta d$ where $\delta = pg$ is the weight density, whereas $p$ is the mass density.
- $1 \frac N {m^2} = 1 Pa$ (Pascal)
