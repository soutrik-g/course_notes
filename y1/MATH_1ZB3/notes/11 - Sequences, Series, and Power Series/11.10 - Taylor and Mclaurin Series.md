##### Observe
$$f(a)=c_0$$

##### Similarily
$$f'(a)=c_1$$

### Definition
The follow is the *Taylor series* for $f$ at $a$ (or about $a$ or centered at *a*).

For the special case with $a=0$, the series becomes the following, named the *Mclaurin series*.

### Definition
The following is named *the $n$-th degree polynomial of f at a*.
$$T_n(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(i)}(a)}{i!}(x-a)^i$$

To help prove that $lim_{n\to\infty} R_n(x) = 0$, we use the following theorem, where $d$ is the radius of convergence.

##### Note
- The series converges if $|x|<1$
- The series converges at 1 if $-1 < k \leq 0$
- The series converges at both endpoints if $k \geq 0$
- Notice: If $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and $n>k$ then $\binom k n$ has a factor $(k-k)$, so $\binom k n = 0$
