# Alternating Series
- Terms alternate between positive and negative

## Alternating Series Test
* An alternating series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^nb_n$, $b_n>0$ <u>converges</u> *if*:
	1) $\displaystyle{\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n=0}$
	2) $b_n \geq b_{n+1}$ (terms are decreasing)
---
### Notes:
If 1) isn't true, then the series diverges by the Test for Divergence. If 1) is true but 2) isn't true, then we get <u>no info</u> from the test.

# Absolute Convergence and Conditional Convergence
- Until now, talked about series either converging or diverging.

---
## Convergence
$$\lim_{k\to\infty} \sum_{n=1}^k \text{exists}$$
## Absolutely Convergent
- When $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|}$ converges

## Conditionally convergent
- $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n}$ converges, but $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|}$ diverges

- If a series is absolutely convergent, then it is convergent, i.e.,
	**If $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|}$ converges, then $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n}$ also converges.**

- In some sense, absolute convergence is like a stronger form of convergence.

If $f\ : U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is of type $C^k$, then
$$\delta_{i_1},\dots,_{i_k}f = \delta_{j_1},\dots,_{j_k}f$$
whenever $(i_1,\dots,i_k)$ and $(j_1,...j_k)$ are re-orders of one another.
