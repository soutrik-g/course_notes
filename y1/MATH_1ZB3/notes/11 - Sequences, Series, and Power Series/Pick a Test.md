# Summary
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$$
Given a series
-> Can we rearrange this into geometric or p-series?
-> Does the test for divergence allow us to say the series diverges?

## Pick a Test
### Integral Test
- If $\int_1^\infty f(x)\ dx$ is easy to calculate

### Comparison Test (Direct & Limit)
- For if series looks similar or identical to a geometric or p-series

### Alternating Series Test
- For alternating series

### Ratio Test
- For factorials `!` in terms of a series`
- <u>or</u> some product of terms involving exponentials `^`

### Root Test
- Helpful if the terms of the series have a power of $n$

##### Multiple tests could be applicable
