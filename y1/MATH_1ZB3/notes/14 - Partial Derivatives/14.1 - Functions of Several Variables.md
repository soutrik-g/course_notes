- $z = f(x, y)$.
- $x$ and $y$ are ***independent variables*** and $z$ is the ***dependent variable***.
- 2-D region instead of 1-D interval.

### Example
*Find the domain and range of $f(x, y) = e^{\sqrt{y - x^2}}$*

domain = what values are we allowed to plug in?
- $y - x^2 \geq 0$ so we're not taking $\sqrt{}$ of a negative number.

$$\begin{align*}
	\Rightarrow D = \{ (x, y) \mid y &\ge x^2 \}
\end{align*}$$

range=  all possible values we can get as outputs.

$$\begin{align*}
	\tag{$\sqrt{y-x^2} \geq 0$}
	z &= f(x, y) = e^{\sqrt{y - x^2}} \\
	\Rightarrow R &= [1, \infty)
\end{align*}$$

### Graphs

- In general, $z = f(x, y) = ax + by + c$ describes a plane
- To look at a function in the *xz-plane*, set $y = 0$ and observe the function like a 1 variable function.

# Level Curves and Contour Maps
- To build contour maps, we need to look for ***level curves***

- Horizontal slice - curve at the height of the surface is *constant*
