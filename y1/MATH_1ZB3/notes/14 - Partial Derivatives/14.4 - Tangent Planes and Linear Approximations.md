# Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations
## Tangent Planes

The ***tangent plane*** to the surface $S$ at point $P$ is the plane that contains both tangent lines $T_1$ and $T_2$. The tangent plane consists of all possible tangent lines at $P$.

- Basically a linear combination

## Linear Approximations
*Idea*: The tangent line approximates a function near a point.
Equation of plane passing through $(x, y, z) = (a, b, c) = (a, b, f(a, b))$:
$$z - c = C_1(x - a) + C_2(y - b)$$
- So solve for the tangent lines, we fix $x = a$ to find the equation along $y$ and fix $y = b$ to find the tangent for $x$.
- $C_1$ and $C_2$ are the slopes for the $x$ and $y$ tangents.

### Example
Use Linear approx. of $f(x, y) = 1 - xy \cos(\pi y)$ at $x=(x, y) = (1, 1)$ to estimate $f(1.02, 0.99)$.

$$\begin{align*}
	f_x(x, y) &= 1 - y \cos (\pi y) \\
	f_x(1, 1) &= - 1(-1) \\
	&= 1 \\
	\\
	f_y(x, y) &= 1 - x (\cos(\pi y) - \pi y \sin(\pi y)) \\
	f_y(1, 1) &= - 1(-1 - \pi (1) (0)) \\
	&= 1 \\
	\\
	z - 2 &= (x - 1) + (y - 1) \\
	z &= x + y \\
	\\
	f(1.02, 0.97) &\approx 1.02 + 0.97 = 1.99
\end{align*}$$

## Differentials
- Measurements can have a margin of error, but we can assume that it is small so we can use a linear approximation to estimate what's going on. 
- If we make some small error d$x$ in our measurement, how much error do we expect in our volume?'

	$$\begin{align*}
		\text{slope of tangent} &= f'(a) \\
		&= \text{rise}/\text{run} \\
		&= \frac{dy}{dx}\\
		dy &= f'(a) \ dx
	\end{align*}$$

- $dx$ - the small error in measurement of independent variable
- $f'(a)$ - Slope of tangent line
- $dy$ - resulting error in dependent variable $\rightarrow$ ***DIFFERENTIAL***

### Two Variables

$$dz = f_x(a, b) dx + f_y(a, b) dy$$
### Example
A rectangular wall is measured to have a length of $30 \pm 0.1$ cm and a width of $24 \pm 0.1$ cm. Use differentials to estimate the max error in calculating the area of this wall.

*differential*:
$$\begin{align*}
	z &= xy \\
	dz &= f_x(a, b) dx + f_y(a, b) dy \\
	f_x(a, b) &= 24 \\
	f_y(a, b) &= 30 \\
	dz &= 24(0.1) + 30(0.1) \\
	&= 5.4 \text{cm}^2
\end{align*}$$

- Calculated area will have an error of $\pm 5.4 \text{cm}^2$. (*or* max error is $5.4 \text{cm}^2$)
