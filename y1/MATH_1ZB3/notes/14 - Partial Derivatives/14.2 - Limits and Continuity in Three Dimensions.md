###### Observe
- $|f(x, y) - L|$ is the distance between $f(x, y)$ and $L$
- $\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}$ is the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(a, b)$.

***Polynomial Function*** - of two variables is a sum of terms of the form $c x^m y^n$, with $c$ a constant and $m, n \in \mathbb Z^{\ge 0}$.

***Rational Function*** - ratio of 2 polynomials.

## Continuity
![[Pasted image 20220326075158.png]]

- Composition of a continuous two variable function $f$ and a continuous function $g$ who's defined on the range of $f$, then $g \circ f := g(f(x, y))$ is also continuous.

## Functions of 3+ Variables

- $x$ and $a$ are tuples in $\mathbb R^n$.
