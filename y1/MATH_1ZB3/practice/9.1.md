*a)*
$$\begin{align*}
	y' &= re^{rx} \\
	y'' &= r^2e^{rx} \\
	\\
	2y'' + y' - y &= 0 \\
	0 
	&=
		2r^2e^{rx} + re^{rx}-e^{rx}
	\\&=
		e^{rx}(2r^2 + r-1)
	\\&=
		e^{rx}(2r-1)(r+1) \\
	r &= \frac 1 2, -1
\end{align*}$$

*b)*
$$\begin{align*}
	y' &= \frac a 2 e^{\frac x 2} - be^{-x} \\
	y'' &= \frac a 4 e^{\frac x 2} + be^{-x} \\
	\\ 0
	&=
		2 \left( \frac a 4 e^{\frac x 2} + be^{-x} \right) 
		+ \frac a 2 e^{\frac x 2} - be^{-x} 
		- (ae^{\frac x 2} + be^{-x}) \\
	&=
		0
\end{align*}$$

*a)*
$$\begin{align*}
	4(-k^2 \cos(kt)) &= -25 \cos(kt) \\
	k^2 \cos(kt) &= \frac{25}{4} \cos(kt) \\
	k &= \pm \frac{5}{2} \\
\end{align*}$$

*b)*
$$\begin{align*}
	4(-(\tfrac 5 2)^2 A \sin(\pm \tfrac 5 2 t)
		- (\tfrac 5 2)^2 B \cos(\pm \tfrac 5 2 t)
	)
	&=
		-25 A \sin(\pm \tfrac 5 2 t) - 25 B \cos (\pm \tfrac 5 2 t) \\
	
	-25 A \sin(\pm \tfrac 5 2 t)
	- 25 B \cos(\pm \tfrac 5 2 t)
	&=
		-25 A \sin(\pm \tfrac 5 2 t) - 25 B \cos (\pm \tfrac 5 2 t) \\
\end{align*}$$

Thus they are equal.

*a)* it is for values $0 < P < 4200$
*b)* it is for values $P>4200$
*c)* they are $P = 0$ and $P = 4200$

*a)* $dy/dt \geq 0$ for all values t and y. Thus, the graph must always be increasing, but this graph is shown to decrease.

*b)* The graph must be proportional to $f(x) = Ce^{kt}$, an exponential function. But this graph does not display an exponential relation, so it can't be a solution to a differential equation.

*a)* $III$ since when $x = y = 0$, the graph is at 0. Also, for all $x \neq y \neq 0$, the slope must be greater than the center and the only graph matching this is $III$.

*b)* $I$ since for $x<0$, $y'<0$ so the graph must be decreasing for $x<0$. The only function matching this description is $I$.

*c)* $IV$ since for $x=y=0$, there is a positive slope at the origin so by elimination since $III$ is already taken it's $IV$.

*d)* $II$ by default.

*a)* the beginning when $t = 0$ since the person is just introduced to the topic so they have a lot of stuff to take in. As $t$ increases, $dP/dt$ decreases since there is a limited amount of things to learn.

*b)* when someone has 0 performance ($P=0$ or $t=0$), that is the maximum value of the differential equation. As $P$ approaches the maximum level of performance however, the rate of growth begins to decline which is what is to be expected.

*c)* no.
