$$\begin{align*}
	\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n
		\frac{2n}{n+4} \\
		\text{but}
	\lim_{n\to\infty} (-1)^n \frac{2n}{n+4} = DNE
\end{align*}$$
so the series is divergent by the test for divergence.

The series is conditionally convergent by the alternating series test since each term in the series is less than the next, and the value approaches 0.
$$\begin{align*}
	\sum \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{3+5n}
\end{align*}$$

The series is divergent by the test for divergence.

![[Pasted image 20220206175908.png]]
The series is absolutely convergent because the series of absolute values is a p series with n>1 plus $-e^-1$

Conditionally convergent because the the alternating series test. Every pair of consequtive values are decreasing and the limit approaches 0.

![[Pasted image 20220206180209.png]]
Divergent because the limit is does not exist so it fails the test for divergence.

$$\begin{align*}
	\sum \left|\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^6}\right|
		&= \sum \frac{1}{n^6}
\end{align*}$$
Which is a p series with $p=6>1$, so the og series is convergent becuse it is absolutely convergent.

$$
	s=\frac{1}{1^6}+\frac{1}{2^6}+\frac{1}{3^6}+\cdots
$$
Notice
$$b_6 \approx 0.00002<0.00005$$
$$b_5 \approx 0.000064>0.00005$$
$$\begin{align*}
	b_{n+1} &< 0.00005 \\
	\frac{1}{(n+1)^6} &< 0.00005 \\
	n &> \sqrt[6]{\frac{1}{0.00005}}-1 \\
	n &> 4.21 \\
	n &\geq 5
\end{align*}$$
So $n=5$ to have accuracy within 0.00005.

Series has decreasing terms and limit approaches 0, so it is convergent.

$$\begin{align*}
	b_{n+1} &< 0.0005 \\
	\frac{1}{(n+1)^22^{n+1}} &< 0.0005 \\
	(n+1)^22^{n+1} &> 2000
\end{align*}$$
Therefore, it's $n=5$.
