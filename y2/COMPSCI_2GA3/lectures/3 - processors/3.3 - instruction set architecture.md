- Stored program processors
- Sequence of instructions stored in memory
- Processor conceptually separate from program and function
- Allows for abstraction

# The Fetch-Execute Cycle
```pascal
ip = start of program
Repeat forever
	instsruction = fetch (memory [ip])
	execute instruction
	ip++
```
- `ip` - the instruction pointer

# Instruction Set Architecture
- The design of all available instructions for a processor is known as the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Defines
	- What instructions are available
	- What each instruction does. Pre/post conditions
	- Number of operands, operand encoding, instruction encoding, result
- Three most-common ISA families today: x86, arm and RISC-V.
