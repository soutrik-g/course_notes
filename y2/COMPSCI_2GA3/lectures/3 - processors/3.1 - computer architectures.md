# Harvard and Von Neumann Architectures
## Harvard Architectures
![[Pasted image 20220926111147.png]]
==NOTE:== Architecture uses two memories, one to hold programs and another to store data.
- Advantage: has memory unit optimized to store programs (*instruction memory*) and another optimized to store data (*data memory*).
- Disadvantage: inflexibility; cannot choose to have instructions stored in data memory and vice versa.

## Von Neumann Architecture

==Note==: both programs and data can be stored in the same memory
- Advantage: Complete flexibility
- ==almost all computers follow the Von Neumann approach==
