# RISC and CISC ISA
## Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)
- Each instruction performs a complex operation
- Instructions take variable number of clock cycles
- Fewer instruction calls

#### Example
x86

## Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
- Each instruction performs simple operation
- Instructions all take same number of clock cycles
- Many instruction calls

#### Example
Arm, Risc-V

# Pipelining
- Computational architecture, improved throughput
- Conditions to use a pipeline computational architecture:
	- Computation can be divided in distinct stages
	- Each stage takes similar time to complete
	- It is efficient to move data between stages

# Risc Pipeline

==NOTE:== pipeline of the five hardware stages that are used to perform the fetch-execute cycle.

When a clock ticks, all stages pass instruction to the right.
