# Binary Fractions
- How do we represent a fractional number?
$$3.5_{10} = \frac{35_{10}}{10_{10}} = \frac{7_{10}}{2_{10}} = \frac{111_2}{10_2} = 11.1_2$$

> [!NOTE] Convert Binary Floating Point to Decimal
>  1. Say we have a binary number $b.f_0f_1f_2f_3\dots$, with $f_0, \dots$ the floating digits.
>2. Multiply by 2, and remove $b$: $f_0.f_1f_2f_3\dots$
>3. If $f_0$ is 1, then that digit is set. In decimal, it will still be 1 since $1_2$ in decimal is still 1.

#### Example: Convert $0.5625$ into binary
$$\begin{align*}
	0.5625 \cdot 2 &= 1.125 \\
	0.125 \cdot 2 &= 0.25 \\
	0.25 \cdot 2 &= 0.5 \\
	0.5 \cdot 2 &= 1
\end{align*}$$
Thus the binary representation is $0.1001$

# Binary Coded Decimal
- Some decimal numbers are infinite binary fractions
$$0.1_{10} = 0.0(0011)_2$$
- inevitable rounding errors
- Alternative: encode every decimal digit in 4 bits (since 9's representation is $1001$ which needs 4 bits.

|Digit Endcoding|0; 0x0|1; 0x1|2; 0x2|3; 0x3|4; 0x4|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Digit Encoding|5; 0x5|6; 0x6|7; 0x7|8; 0x8|9; 0x9|

# Representing Characters
- ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- One byte characters
- What about non-standard characters?
- Unicode UTF-8 set: variable length encoding
- 21-bit encoding in up to 4-byte field
	- 11 bits are reserved for some weird leading bit shit

- Data packed by compiler (everything is contiguous in memory)
- not a great idea
- Has something to do with assignment
