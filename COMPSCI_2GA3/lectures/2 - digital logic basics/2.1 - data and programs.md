How is data stared in memory?
- Often thing of it as an array
	- an array of cells, each cell has an index, each cell stores a byte
	- can query the memory at the index
- Reality, physical memory is not byte addressable, but word addressable
- Words
	- Size depends on architecture
	- 64x architecture - 4 bytes
	- 86x architecture - 8 bytes
- ***Little and Big Endian***
	- *Big Endian* - most significant bit is stored first
	- *Little Endian* - least significant bit is stored first
